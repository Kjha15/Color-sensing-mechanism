# Color-sensing-mechanism

This project was done as a part of my Graduate subject (Embedded Systems)
Hardware used: Tiva launchpad, Arduino, Adafruit color sensor, servo motors. 
Arduino and the launchpad's communication protocol was I2C. Servos were connected with the help of PWM module and UART was used for debugging purposes. 
Data was then observed on the terminal with the help of Logic analyzer.
